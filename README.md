- 👋 Hi, I’m @mrdonjones
- 👀 I’m interested in everything, sadly.  I love information, learning skills, pretty much adding to the hoarder's nest inside my head.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning git. And installing android studio correctly on my pc, and getting all the plug-ins to work.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this project I've decided to attempt, which isn't anything revolutionary but might turn into a useful app/site.  It's a curated library of tutorials for fixing things.  
- 📫 How to reach me: jones.donaldw@gmail.com or dwjones210@outlook.com
